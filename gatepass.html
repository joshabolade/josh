                        <h3>How it all started!</h3>
                        <p>The story of this project begins with the HNG 6.0 internship. The HNG internship brings thousands of learners around the world under one community to collaborate and procure solutions that can solve real-life problems. While I was in the design track and at stage 4, we were asked to provide a solution for communities. Apparently we were divided into two teams of designers and my team decided to design a gate pass solution for gatted communities. Well, we called it GatePass. lol. The solution was targeted at those people living in gated communities and the gatemen for proper management of visitors and community security. Before the design of this app, residents would have problems with visitors' access to the communities and may have to sometimes go to the gate to identify their visitors. Even sometimes unwanted visitors may be given access to the estate. This application also improves the security management of the communities. I was one of the designers among a couple of other designers who were given this task to brainstorm and design this solution.</p>

                        <h3>Personas</h3>
                        <p>Based on the interviews/workshop we set up two personas Tade and Wunmi. We referred to them throughout the entire product development process. My team decided that we would want our product to be human-centered and also human-centered. In this light, we decided to create two very different personas; one that loves his quiet and one that would prefer more guests around. We used the data gathered from the interviews to create these personas. From the interviews, we were informed of the channels used for social interaction by users, their motivations and their major pain points. We also got the idea that there were certain visitors that some residents would not want at all in their homes so we added the banned list feature where residents can input people they don't want to see. The personas were reflected on through-out the design so that the app would be convenient for everyone irrespective of who you are.</p>

                        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                        <p>At the beginning of our visual design process, we created wireframes for testing purposes. This was very important because it helped us focus on the user journey and easily iterate the design a couple of times without having to worry about colors and images. It's also quite easy to transit from low fidelity to high fidelity when an agreed structure is already available. We were a remote team so we used Figma for our Mockups and Prototyping because of its collaboration feature and mostly because we love using the tool. These wireframes were used for alpha testing to have a feel of the entire walk-through experience after 4 iterations we finally concluded on a structure. </p>

                        <h3>UI Design</h3>
                        <p>Once we tested out all usability mistakes, we started designing the final screens in Figma. We decided to go with the light visual style and also in the future incorporate the dark mode. We were inspired by the KISS rule because it was important to us that our users have good clarity about what they want to achieve with this application in the quickest time possible. We designed the site in such a way that it can be integrated for use in both all webrowsers and screen sizes including mobile devices. Most of our users would want to easily add visitors to the expect list or add some visitors to the banned list without compromising the details required for security which makes me particularly thrilled about the simplicity of the application and how easy it is to navigate through it.</p>

                        <h3>What I learned from this project.</h3>
                        <p>Sincerely, I was first of all skeptical about the way this project would turn out because of the number of designers on the team and the fact that it was remote. Though we struggled a bit in the beginning, we were determined to make this work thanks to Figma's collaboration feature it was easy to share ideas and make iterations.</p>
                        <p> I learned a lot about remote collaboration in this project and I have now acquired a great measure of possibility mentality when it comes to remote-collaboration.</p>
                        <p>Our design was chosen as the winning design and my team won the competition.</p>
