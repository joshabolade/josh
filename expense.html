                    <h3>About the project</h3>
                    <p>So this product was borne from the concerns of the citizezns of Nigeria on how the government
                        spends public funds. Most of the transactions done by the government are done behind closed
                        doors and very few people know about it. The only channel to know this expenditure is a very
                        confusing website that seems to be designed to stress you into giving up your search. So we at
                        expenseNG decided to create a platform that simplifies the government daily expenses and also
                        tweets its findings for better coverage and more publicity of the expenditures. This product is
                        created for the public and masses who are intrested in the expenditure of the government and we
                        expect that this should be every citizen of the nation. Our goal is to use this platform to
                        reduce corruption because we believe that whern theres light very fewer evil can be done. The
                        more informed the masses the mpre they can channel their frustration to the right source.</p>

                    <p> In this project i was the LEAD DESIGNER and I worked with a group of developers and designers
                        who helped bring this product into reality.</p>

                    <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of our visual design process, we created wireframes for testing purposes. This
                        was very important because it helped us focus on the user journey and easily iterate the design
                        a couple of times without having to worry about colors and images. It's also quite easy to
                        transit from low fidelity to high fidelity when an agreed structure is already available. We
                        were a remote team so we used Figma for our Mockups and Prototyping because of its collaboration
                        feature and mostly because we love using the tool. These wireframes were used for alpha testing
                        to have a feel of the entire walk-through experience after 4 iterations we finally concluded on
                        a structure. </p>

                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <p>Before the lanching of the product, I did several testing rounds both alpha and beta testing, in
                        order to reveal possible usability problems. First of all I wanted to be sure we were not
                        delivernig an information overload to the users. I wanted to focus on the most important
                        information so that we do not repeat what was done in the government’s site. I also wanted to
                        test if the infographics I used were understandable by the layman. Don’t want to be the only one
                        that gets my design. These testing actually led to reitration of the site and total revamp of my
                        initial design uhh!!. But it was worth it. Whtas the use of designing someting that’s meant for
                        the public if they woudn’t use it. </p>

                    <h3>UI Design</h3>
                    <p>Once we tested out all usability mistakes, we started designing the final screens in Figma. We
                        decided to go with the light visual style and also in the future incorporate the dark mode. We
                        were inspired by the KISS rule because it was important to us that our users have good clarity
                        about what they want to achieve with this application in the quickest time possible. We designed
                        the site in such a way that it can be integrated for use in both all webrowsers and screen sizes
                        including mobile devices. Most of our users would want to easily add visitors to the expect list
                        or add some visitors to the banned list without compromising the details required for security
                        which makes me particularly thrilled about the simplicity of the application and how easy it is
                        to navigate through it.</p>

                    <h3>My Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Making a differene in a country like mine is quite phenomenom and ‘m actually particulally proud
                        to be a part of this project. And i can’t wait for it to begin to have its full impact on the
                        masses. I was really excited about this project when i first got it and I still am. I really
                        want to make a diffrence and if i do it thorugh design I’d do it over and over again. </p>
