                    <h3>About the project</h3>
                    <p>MicroAPI is a platform designed to help web developers in creating products and websites without
                        neccessarily having to code. It serves as a platform for users to get all the rescources needed
                        for web creation. My design task was focused on building a web app for frontend building. So the
                        MicroAPI Frontend Builder as its called is supposed to help users design a fully working
                        frontend of their site using preset templates and HTML/CSS components. This app is geared
                        towards helping the layman to build a website of his own without having to go through the rigous
                        of coding it himselt or outscourcing it. I designed it to make it simple to use and understand.
                        The app would need little or no training at all. In the app, I also integrated a section for
                        advanced users that may want to inject their own codessuch as custom styling and JavaScript
                        functions that would be exclusively available to them, or could be published and added as a
                        contribution in the microAPI paltform. <br>
                        I functioned in the role of a section lead, in which led the frontend builder section .</p>

                    <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of our visual design process, we created wireframes for testing purposes. This
                        was very important because it helped us focus on the user journey and easily iterate the design
                        a couple of times without having to worry about colors and images. It's also quite easy to
                        transit from low fidelity to high fidelity when an agreed structure is already available. We
                        were a remote team so we used Figma for our Mockups and Prototyping because of its collaboration
                        feature and mostly because we love using the tool. These wireframes were used for alpha testing
                        to have a feel of the entire walk-through experience after 4 iterations we finally concluded on
                        a structure. </p>

                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <p>Before the lanching of the product, I did several testing rounds both alpha and beta testing, in
                        order to reveal possible usability problems. First of all I wanted to be sure we were not
                        delivernig an information overload to the users. I wanted to focus on the most important
                        information so that we do not repeat what was done in the government’s site. I also wanted to
                        test if the infographics I used were understandable by the layman. Don’t want to be the only one
                        that gets my design. These testing actually led to reitration of the site and total revamp of my
                        initial design uhh!!. But it was worth it. Whtas the use of designing someting that’s meant for
                        the public if they woudn’t use it. </p>

                    <h3>UI Design</h3>
                    <p>Once we tested out all usability mistakes, we started designing the final screens in Figma. We
                        decided to go with the light visual style and also in the future incorporate the dark mode. We
                        were inspired by the KISS rule because it was important to us that our users have good clarity
                        about what they want to achieve with this application in the quickest time possible. We designed
                        the site in such a way that it can be integrated for use in both all webrowsers and screen sizes
                        including mobile devices. Most of our users would want to easily add visitors to the expect list
                        or add some visitors to the banned list without compromising the details required for security
                        which makes me particularly thrilled about the simplicity of the application and how easy it is
                        to navigate through it.</p>

                    <h3>My Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This project up to this moment, has been my most challenging work. To me it was more like
                        designinig an app that designers wold use in designing desings. And I think that was a challenge
                        worth taking. This project project also opened my eyes to the posibility of other design areas
                        that i can specialise in, like software design vehicle design, drone designs etc. After this
                        project I think I’m open to any form of designs as long as it is solving a problem. I’m
                        particularly proud of this project because it’s a first of its kind for me and the beginig of
                        many more projects like it in the later future. </p>
